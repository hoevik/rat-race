#If done again, what would I do differently?
At this point my game is really bad, even though I have spent all week working on it. If done again, I would have allocated my time more rational, and focused on getting the page MVP before trying to do something fancy(eg. test.js). I would also asked the TA and other students more. A boy should have no pride.
